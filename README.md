**Problems**

**Problem-1: Calculator**

Create a small calculator which performs operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using a class.

Inputs:

 - a : double

 - b : double

 - operation : string

---

**Problem-2: Odd Number Series**

With a single integer as input, generate the series:

Example:

Input: a = 3

Output:

    1) input a = 1, then output : 1
    2) input a = 2, then output : 1, 3
    3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5

---

Problem-3: Odd Series (Pattern Variant)

With a single integer as input, generate numbers until a = x.

Example:

Input: a = 4

Output:

    1) input a = 1, then output : 1
    2) input a = 2, then output : 1
    3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5
    4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5

---

**Problem-4: Multiples Count in List**

Count how many numbers in a list are divisible by 1–9.

Example:

Input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]

Output: 
```
{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
```
